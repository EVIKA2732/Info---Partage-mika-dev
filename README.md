Info & Partage is first and foremost a blog, entertainment, sharing,

but also and above all the exchange, full of features will arrive depending on the time I could put in. This app will allow you, for example, to exchange in multiple ways, your knowledge, or simply to help each other in bulk, or you will have the possibility, among others, to make suggestions likely to modify the way this app works.

The app will allow you, for example, to promote a particular product (pastries, electronic product, clothing) using geolocation with your agreement, in order to get closer to those who share the same interests in a specific sport, to share photos of sunset, thanks to a small technology that I have integrated, you will not even need to make several manipulations to share and post. Surf the web in a secure way, exchange on an encrypted server from end to end, using tor relays (dynamic server).

No cookies are stored, no history is stored, absolutely nothing, except geolocation on a temporary basis (only while you use the application).

Many surprises are coming.

Stay tuned.

Info & sharing will also allow you to learn about my projects on GitHub, or to find out more, about how I developed the site, the project is published in full transparency. From (future) moderator, will be able to integrate the moderation group on the site, if you find my email address, which is both hidden in the app, but also on the site.

;) :)
